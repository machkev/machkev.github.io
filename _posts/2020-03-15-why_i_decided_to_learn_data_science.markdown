For more than ten years, I have worked primarily in marketing, sales and client services divisions in the financial services industry. One of my first roles involved a lot of manual data entry, form filling and completing repetitive data points and content across multiple platforms, including spreadsheets, word documents and online databases.  This was, to say the least, time consuming, mind-numbing and extremely prone to errors due to the manual nature of the process.

My real experience with code came in a subsequent role, where part of my responsibilities, albeit small, was to update documents and content on the company’s website. Although the website was written using java, my basic training in HTML was good enough to figure out what was going on in the website repository. I also taught myself how to publish updated content onto the website by studying the past records of the activities in the repository. This was my first real-life experience with GitHub where I was thrown into the proverbial deep end left to swim. With no formal training on Git, I was able to push and publish content onto the website and the process was very satisfying! 

With the skills in data science combined with my knowledge in in the financial services industry, I am looking to improve and develop tools that would make the process of managing and using product information more efficiently. I would also like to learn how to use data science skills to make more informed investment decisions that will help select appropriate investments, while reducing risk and will maximize returns in the short and longer term.

As I make progress in the program, I keep wondering why I didn’t embark on this course much sooner as this is exactly what I need to transform my career. But as the Chinese proverb goes: “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.”
